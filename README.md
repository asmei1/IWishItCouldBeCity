# IWishItCouldBeCity

IWishItCouldBeCity is a testing/experimental project to learn something about
- spdlog and fmt libraries
- managing projects using cmake
- vulkan 
- procedural generating of city

Ultimately, the result of the project will be the procedural generation of the city model on the proprietary 3D engine. NVBEngine (Next Very Bad Engine) will use the Vulkan and GLFW frameworks.  
There is a good chance the project will never be finished and the code will be nasty. BUT I will try :)
